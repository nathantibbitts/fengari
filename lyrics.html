<h2>Escape</h2>
<h3>Lyrics and music by HEX/Blue</h3>
<p class="lyrics">
"Oh The music and the lanterns, it was cold out. <br>
In the winter We were dancing, in the moonlight.<br>
In this old town, Where you left me, I was broken<br>
How it turned out we had so much broke our promise.<br>

I just want- I just need- a new way to think about it <br>
I can&rsquo;t breathe- I can&rsquo;t think- all I want&rsquo;s for you to come back<br>
All I want&hellip; all I need&rsquo;s&hellip; an escape.<br>
Escape. With. Me. <br>
Escape. With. Me&hellip;<br>
<br>
Oh this music and the lyrics won&rsquo;t betray me<br>
Like you did then oh it hurt then almost killed me<br>
But the music and the rhythms keep me going.<br>
Like it did then people mocked me broke the silence.<br>
<br>
All I want- all I need- is a line to change my future <br>
All I am- all I&rsquo;ll be- is a girl dropped out of high school.<br>
All I want&hellip; all I need&rsquo;s&hellip; escape.<br>
Escape. With. Me. <br>
Escape. With. Me. <br>
<br>
(Let the music fill your heart now let it heal you.<br>
If I die soon would you even fucking cry then?<br>
Would you regret all the anguish pain you caused me?<br>
Can I come back would you take me broken pieces.<br>
<br>
Oh the music never stops now it just repeats&hellip;<br>
Like a record. Broken pieces. Your just like me.<br>
And to think I almost killed her, in the mirror&hellip;<br>
Can we escape to a new place!? no more standards&hellip;)<br>
<br>
I just can&rsquo;t&hellip;<br>
I give in&hellip;<br>
All I wants a little comfort <br>
Can you help?<br>
Can you heal?<br>
This broken record needs you<br>
All I want&hellip;<br>
All I need&rsquo; s&hellip;<br>
Escape."

<h2>Benedictus Sixtus</h2>
<h3>Lyrics by Nathan TIbbitts</h3>
<p>
 Benedictus Sixtus <br>
Will you convict us? <br>
Benedictus Sixtus <br>
We are Invictus <br>
<br>
Benedictus Sixtus <br>
Benedictus Sixtus <br>
What words do you have for me? <br>
Benedictus Sixtus <br>
Do you believe you ripped us? <br>
Benedictus Sixtus <br>
Breakdown <br>
When all turns to hell <br>
And life’s not going well <br>
Remember these words: <br>
”It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful:  <br>
 they are found because it was possible to find them. And yet, we are so absorbed in listening to meaningless <br>
 music where people brag about being promiscuous, when we could have cured cancer by now! Music is a force to be <br>
 reckoned with if used correctly, and those who use it incorrectly will reckon with my fist!” <br>
Benedictus Sixtus <br>
How words can Depict us.

<h2>Lost and Found</h2>
<h3>Words by Hex/Blue</h3>
<h3>Music by Nathan Tibbitts and Hex/Blue</h3>
<p>So here I tread<br>
About your bed<br>
And I’m waiting here for you<br>
But then I dread<br>
Inside my head<br>
As I’m running through my past<br>
And It’s not easy!<br>
No, It’s not easy!<br>
To be sure, to be here, to be...<br>
1, 2, 3, 4,<br>
WOAH<br>
I feel lost! I feel lost! i feel lost!<br>
And woah!<br>
Are we lost? are we lost? are we…<br>
Here<br>
So here I go<br>
To find your soul<br>
And I’m sorry I’m a mess<br>
And so I’m told<br>   Ju
st what I know<br>
Am I giving you my best?<br>
And It’s not easy<br>
No It’s not easy <br>
But I’m okay I’m okay I’m oh-<br>
Kay<br>
(1, 2, 3, 4)<br>
WOAH<br>
Do you feel lost? Do you feel lost? <br>
Do you feel… found<br>
cause woah!<br>
Cause I feel lost, I feel lost, <br>
Yeah I feel… You…   But when you kissed my face <br>
I didn’t know,  I didn’t know,<br>
I never knew <br>
that you’d always cared, you always cared I always, cared. <br>
OOOOH<br>
And I wish I told you <br>
How I felt, in 2012, I wish I knew<br>
That you’d say yes, To my request <br>
I wish I knew you!<br>
Because I loved you<br>
And you felt pain, you felt pain<br>
You felt pain<br>
because You blame yourself, <br>
you’re not at fault<br>
It’s not your fault!!
