<h2>Escape</h2>
<h3>Lyrics and music by HEX/Blue</h3>
<p id="lyrics">
"Oh The music and the lanterns, it was cold out. </br>
In the winter We were dancing, in the moonlight.</br>
In this old town, Where you left me, I was broken</br>
How it turned out we had so much broke our promise.</br>

I just want- I just need- a new way to think about it </br>
I can&rsquo;t breathe- I can&rsquo;t think- all I want&rsquo;s for you to come back</br>
All I want&hellip; all I need&rsquo;s&hellip; an escape.</br>
Escape. With. Me. </br>
Escape. With. Me&hellip;</br>
</br>
Oh this music and the lyrics won&rsquo;t betray me</br>
Like you did then oh it hurt then almost killed me</br>
But the music and the rhythms keep me going.</br>
Like it did then people mocked me broke the silence.</br>
</br>
All I want- all I need- is a line to change my future </br>
All I am- all I&rsquo;ll be- is a girl dropped out of high school.</br>
All I want&hellip; all I need&rsquo;s&hellip; escape.</br>
Escape. With. Me. </br>
Escape. With. Me. </br>
</br>
(Let the music fill your heart now let it heal you.</br>
If I die soon would you even fucking cry then?</br>
Would you regret all the anguish pain you caused me?</br>
Can I come back would you take me broken pieces.</br>
</br>
Oh the music never stops now it just repeats&hellip;</br>
Like a record. Broken pieces. Your just like me.</br>
And to think I almost killed her, in the mirror&hellip;</br>
Can we escape to a new place!? no more standards&hellip;)</br>
</br>
I just can&rsquo;t&hellip;</br>
I give in&hellip;</br>
All I wants a little comfort </br>
Can you help?</br>
Can you heal?</br>
This broken record needs you</br>
All I want&hellip;</br>
All I need&rsquo; s&hellip;</br>
Escape."

<h2>Benedictus Sixtus</h2>
<h3>Lyrics by Nathan TIbbitts</h3>
<p>
 Benedictus Sixtus </br>
Will you convict us? </br>
Benedictus Sixtus </br>
We are Invictus </br>
</br>
Benedictus Sixtus </br>
Benedictus Sixtus </br>
What words do you have for me? </br>
Benedictus Sixtus </br>
Do you believe you ripped us? </br>
Benedictus Sixtus </br>
Breakdown </br>
When all turns to hell </br>
And life’s not going well </br>
Remember these words: </br>
”It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful:  </br>
 they are found because it was possible to find them. And yet, we are so absorbed in listening to meaningless </br>
 music where people brag about being promiscuous, when we could have cured cancer by now! Music is a force to be </br>
 reckoned with if used correctly, and those who use it incorrectly will reckon with my fist!” </br>
Benedictus Sixtus </br>
How words can Depict us.
